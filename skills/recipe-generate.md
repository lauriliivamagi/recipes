# Recipe Generate Skill

Generate self-contained interactive HTML recipe pages from structured JSON. This skill guides the use of `lib/recipe-build.js` or provides the logic for inline generation.

## Running the Builder

```bash
# Build a single recipe
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/recipe-build.js --slug <category/slug>

# Build all recipes
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/recipe-build.js

# Rebuild index only
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/recipe-build.js --index-only
```

## Build Process

### Inputs

1. **Recipe JSON** from `recipes/<category>/<slug>.json`
2. **HTML template** from `templates/recipe.html`
3. **i18n strings** from `templates/i18n/<lang>.json` (falls back to `en.json`)
4. **Phase maps** — computed by the recipe-optimize skill (relaxed + optimized)

### Output

A single self-contained HTML file at `site/<category>/<slug>.html`.

Self-contained means:
- All CSS is inlined (no external stylesheets)
- All JavaScript is inlined (no external scripts)
- No network requests after initial page load
- No framework dependencies — vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
- Works when opened directly as a file in any modern browser

## HTML Structure: Two Views

### View 1: Phase Map Overview

The planning/comprehension view shown by default.

Elements:
- **Toggle switch** at top: Relaxed / Optimized (switches phase layout and time estimate)
- **Equipment summary** — list of all needed equipment
- **Servings adjuster** — number input, recalculates all quantities
- **Phase cards** flowing top-to-bottom:
  - Phase label with color coding: PREP (orange), COOK (teal), SIMMER/PASSIVE (purple), FINISH (neutral)
  - Time estimate for the phase
  - Tasks with inline ingredients (quantities bolded)
  - Parallel tasks shown side-by-side when applicable
  - Passive vs active distinction
- **Tap any phase** to jump to that step in the cooking view

### View 2: Step-by-Step Cooking View

The phone-friendly cooking guide, activated by a "Start Cooking" button.

Elements:
- **Awareness bar** (top) — compact status pills for background/passive tasks with countdown timers
- **Focus card** (center) — the current step expanded:
  - Step counter ("Step 3 of 8")
  - Action headline
  - Detailed instructions with inline ingredients (quantities bolded)
  - Tags: timer duration, heat level, equipment
  - Large Back/Next touch targets
- **Parallel active tasks** — when two tasks need active attention:
  - Primary task as full focus card
  - Secondary task as compact card below, tappable to expand/swap
- **Next-up preview** — dimmed preview of the next step

### Interactive Features

- **Servings adjuster**: Recalculates quantities by ratio (newServings / originalServings). Rounding rules per unit type. Prep times scale proportionally; operations with `scalable: false` keep their original time. Equipment overflow warning above 2x.
- **Built-in timers**: Start per step, countdown in awareness bar, browser Notification API on completion.
- **Dark mode**: Default theme (less glare in kitchen). Light mode toggle available.

## i18n Integration

- Load strings from `templates/i18n/<meta.language>.json`
- Fall back to `templates/i18n/en.json` if the language file does not exist
- UI chrome (buttons, labels, phase names) uses i18n strings
- Recipe content stays in its original language (never translated)

## Index Page Generation

When building the index (`--index-only` or full build):

1. Scan `recipes/**/*.json` for all recipes
2. Extract `meta` from each (title, slug, tags, totalTime, difficulty, language)
3. Load `templates/index.html`
4. Generate `site/index.html` with:
   - Recipe cards grouped by category
   - Search/filter by title and tags
   - Difficulty and time badges
   - Links to each recipe's HTML page

## Inline Generation (Fallback)

If `lib/recipe-build.js` does not exist yet, generate the HTML inline:

1. Read the recipe JSON
2. Read the template (or generate from scratch if template does not exist)
3. Read i18n strings (or use hardcoded English defaults)
4. Compute phase maps using the recipe-optimize skill
5. Build the HTML string with all CSS and JS inlined
6. Write to `site/<category>/<slug>.html`, creating directories as needed
7. Verify the file was written and report its size
